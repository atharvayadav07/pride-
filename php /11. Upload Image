//Step 1: HTML Form (upload_image.html)

<form action="upload_image.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  Select image to upload:<br>
  <input type="file" name="image"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Upload Image">
</form>

//Step 2: PHP Upload Script (upload_image.php)
<?php
$target_dir = "uploads/";  // Folder to save uploaded images
$target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["image"]["name"]);
$imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));

// Check if image file is a real image
$check = getimagesize($_FILES["image"]["tmp_name"]);
if($check === false) {
    echo "File is not an image.";
    exit;
}

// Allow only JPG, PNG, GIF
$allowed = ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif"];
if (!in_array($imageFileType, $allowed)) {
    echo "Only JPG, JPEG, PNG, and GIF files are allowed.";
    exit;
}

// Upload image
if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["image"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)) {
    echo "Image uploaded successfully: <br>";
    echo "<img src='$target_file' width='200'>";
} else {
    echo "Failed to upload image.";

🔔 Important:

* Make sure uploads/ folder has write permission (e.g., chmod 777 uploads on Linux).

* Use getimagesize() to verify if uploaded file is really an image.
